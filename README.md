# CrowdCoin
A decentralized crowdfunding platform based on the ethereum blockchain.
The project is a decentralized crowdfunding application, built to solve the problem of money being misused by people, collected using the traditional crowdfunding applications.
Blockchain helped in keeping track of the money collected using the application, and storing it under the control of a piece of code. Hence not letting the money get into the hands of anyone and removing every possibility of it getting misused. Thus allowing us to reach to a logical solution to the problem in hand.
Same as crowd funding in the real world, you can create campaigns requiring minimum contribution. The creator can propose how to use money and how much money is needed as a 'Request'. He cannot use money without more than 50% approvers in voting.
